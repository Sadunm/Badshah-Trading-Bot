- Target: +5-10%

### Month 2: $200 (if profitable)
- If Month 1 profitable
- If win rate 55%+
- Double capital

### Month 3: $500 (if still profitable)
- If Month 2 profitable
- If consistent results
- Increase to $500

### Month 4+: Gradual increases
- Only if consistently profitable
- Never more than 50% increase at once
- Always keep risk capital only

## 📈 Expected Returns (Realistic)

```
Conservative Bot (Your Current Setup):
✅ Monthly Target: 5-10%
✅ Good Month: 10-15%
✅ Excellent Month: 15-20%
❌ Don't Expect: 50%+ monthly

Example with $100:
Month 1: $100 → $110 (+10%)
Month 2: $110 → $121 (+10%)
Month 3: $121 → $133 (+10%)
Month 6: $177
Month 12: $313

Compound growth is powerful!
